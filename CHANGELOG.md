# Changelog

All notable changes to Campbooks Next are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Foundation for the rewrite: Rust API skeleton (kernel, AI gateway, `system`
  module with health and version), one React/TypeScript client with a Tauri 2
  shell, OpenSpec workflow, architecture decision records, CI quality and
  security gates, and docker compose for self-hosting.
- The server image now serves the web app next to the API on the same port:
  set `CAMPBOOKS_WEB_DIR` to a built client (the image does this for you).
  Deep links fall back to the app, hashed assets are cached for a year, and
  every response carries security headers (a strict CSP on pages).
- Interim `/bff/api/*` passthrough to the API so the web app works from the
  image before the session-based BFF lands. It adds no credentials.
